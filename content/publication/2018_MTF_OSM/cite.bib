    abstract = "In the present contribution, we consider Helmholtz equation with material coefficients being constant in each subdomain of a geometric partition of the propagation medium (discarding the presence of junctions), and we are interested in the numerical solution of such a problem by means of local multi-trace boundary integral formulations (local-MTF). For a one dimensional problem and configurations with two subdomains, it has been recently established that applying a Jacobi iterative solver to local-MTF is exactly equivalent to an Optimised Schwarz Method (OSM) with a non-local impedance. In the present contribution, we show that this correspondence still holds in the case where the subdomain partition involves an arbitrary number of subdomains. From this, we deduce that the depth of the adjacency graph of the subdomain partition plays a critical role in the convergence of linear solvers applied to local-MTF: we prove it for the case of homogeneous propagation medium and show, through numerical evidences, that this conclusion still holds for heterogeneous media. Our study also shows that, considering variants of local-MTF involving a relaxation parameter, there is a fixed value of this relaxation parameter that systematically leads to optimal speed of convergence for linear solvers."
