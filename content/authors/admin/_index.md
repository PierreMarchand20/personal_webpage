I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bath, where I am working with [Euan Spence](http://people.bath.ac.uk/eas25/). I am part of the EPSRC-funded project [At the interface between semiclassical analysis and numerical analysis of wave propagation problems](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R005591/1).

My research focuses on wave propagation problems, Decomposition Domain Methods (DDM) and Boundary Integral Equations (BIE). I am also developing a library for hierarchical matrix techniques called [Htool]({{< ref "/project/htool/index.md" >}}) with a parallelized matrix-vector product using MPI. It is used by [FreeFEM](https://freefem.org) and available via C++ or Python.

Previously, I did my Ph.D under the supervision of [Xavier Claeys](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~claeys/) and [Frédéric Nataf](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/nataf/) at Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions ([LJLL](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr)) in Sorbonne Université, and I was a member of the joint Inria-LJLL project team [Alpines](https://team.inria.fr/alpines/). My thesis was funded by the ANR (French National Research Agency) via the ANR project [NonlocalDD](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~claeys/nonlocaldd/index.html).
