I am a researcher at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) in [POEMS](https://uma.ensta-paris.fr/poems/main/presentation.html?lang=en) team. My research focuses on wave propagation problems, Decomposition Domain Methods (DDM) and Boundary Integral Equations (BIE). I am also developing a library for distributed compressed matrices called [Htool](https://htool-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) using MPI. It can be used via [FreeFEM](https://freefem.org) for solving BIEs, via [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for black-box compression, and directly via C++ or its Python interface.

I also teach at [ENSTA](https://www.ensta-paris.fr) courses related to applied mathematics and programming. I wrote [Computer Tools](https://pmarchand.pages.math.cnrs.fr/computertools) to introduce useful tools for programming.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bath, where I worked with [Euan Spence](http://people.bath.ac.uk/eas25/). I did my Ph.D under the supervision of [Xavier Claeys](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~claeys/) and [Frédéric Nataf](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/nataf/) at Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions ([LJLL](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr)) in Sorbonne Université, and I was a member of the joint Inria-LJLL project team [Alpines](https://team.inria.fr/alpines/). My thesis was funded by the ANR (French National Research Agency) via the ANR project [NonlocalDD](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~claeys/nonlocaldd/index.html).
