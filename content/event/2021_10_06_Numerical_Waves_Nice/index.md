  We study a commonly-used second-kind boundary-integral equation for solving the Helmholtz exterior Neumann problem at high frequency, namely the Regularized Combined Field Integral Equation (RCFIE)[^1]. Writing $\\Gamma$ for the boundary of the obstacle, this integral operator map $L^2(\\Gamma)$ to itself, contrary to its non-regularized version.

  We prove new frequency-explicit bounds on the norms of both the RCFIE and its inverse. The bounds on the norm are valid for piecewise-smooth $\\Gamma$ and are sharp, and the bounds on the norm of the inverse are valid for smooth $\\Gamma$ and are observed to be sharp at least when $\\Gamma$ is curved.

  Together, these results give bounds on the condition number of the operator on $L^2(\\Gamma)$; this is the first time $L^2(\\Gamma)$ condition-number bounds have been proved for this operator for obstacles other than balls[^2].
