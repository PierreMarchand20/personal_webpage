## CEMRACS 2016 Numerical challenges in parallel scientific computing July 18th - August 26th

I attended a one-week course on HPC and numerical methods, followed by a five-week project supervised by [Xavier Claeys](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~claeys/), Ibtihel Ben Gharbia and Pierre-Henri Tournier. I worked for six weeks on the project ElastoPhi with [Marcella Bonazzoli](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/bonazzoli/).

We studied the efficiency of a *complexity reduction technique* based on hierarchical matrices and adaptive cross approximation applied to matrices provided by [IFPEN](http://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com) (French Institut of Petroleum). Those matrices came from the discretization of an elastostatic problem posed at the surface of highly *irregular crack networks*.

Our *C++ library* is available [here](https://github.com/xclaeys/ElastoPhi). For more details see the corresponding [proceeding](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01644518).
