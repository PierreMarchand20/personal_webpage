<!-- Htool is an implementation of hierarchical matrices (cf. this [reference](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783662473238) or this [one](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540771463)), it was written to test *Domain Decomposition Methods* (DDM) applied to *Boundary Element Method* (BEM). It provides:

- routines to build hierarchical matrix structures (cluster trees, block trees, low-rank matrices and block matrices),
- parallel matrix-vector and matrix-matrix product using MPI and OpenMP,
- preconditioning techniques using domain decomposition methods,
- the possibility to use Htool with any generator of coefficients (e.g., your own BEM library),
- an interface with [HPDDM](https://github.com/hpddm/hpddm) for iterative solvers,
- GUI and several service functions to display informations about matrix structures and timing,
- a Python interface.

Htool is written by Pierre-Henri Tournier and I, it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/htool-ddm/htool). -->
