  Boundary integral equations (BIE) are a reformulation of partial differential
  equations with non-local integral operators. It has the advantage to reduce
  the dimension of the geometric domain and to be able to naturally formulate
  problems on open domains. This kind of reformulation is widely used in
  acoustic, electromagnetic and mechanics. The matrices obtained after
  discretisation of these equations have the disadvantage to be fully populated,
  which leads us to use iterative linear solvers such as conjugated gradient or
  GMRes to solve the associated linear systems. To stabilize the number of
  iterations of these solvers with respect to the mesh size, a classical
  technique is to use a preconditioner. In this talk, after introducing BIE, we
  will present a method to precondition these matrices using domain
  decompositions methods and its analysis. This is a joint work with Xavier
  Claeys and Frédéric Nataf.
