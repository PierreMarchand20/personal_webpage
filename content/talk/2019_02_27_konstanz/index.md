abstract: >-
  Boundary integral equations are reformulations of partial differential
  equations with non-local integral operators. Widely used in acoustics,
  electromagnetism and mechanics, they have the advantage to reduce the
  dimension of the geometric domain and they naturally satisfy conditions at
  infinity for problems on open domains. But the matrices obtained after
  discretisation have the disadvantage to be fully populated, which leads us to
  use iterative linear solvers, such as conjugated gradient or GMRes, to solve
  the associated linear systems. To stabilise the number of iterations of these
  solvers with respect to the mesh size, a classical technique is to use a
  preconditioner. \ In this talk, we will present a method to precondition these
  matrices using domain decomposition methods, and more precisely, Schwarz
  Methods with a particular coarse space named GenEO whose construction is based
  on Generalized Eigenproblems in the Overlaps. This is a joint work with Xavier
  Claeys and Frédéric Nataf.
